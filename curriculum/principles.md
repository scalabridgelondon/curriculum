# Curriculum Design Principles

This is a checklist of things to consider in curriculum design.


## Connect

Look for examples that connect programming to other contexts, to make what the students are learning more relevant to them. 


## More Than Programming

Programming consists of more than writing code. Other aspects can be divided into two main categories:

1. Processes, such as pair programming, debugging, and testing.
2. Tools, such as version control, sbt, and IDE.

Consider if there is an opportunity to touch on these aspects.


## Less Than Programming

It's natural to create exercises that ask students to write code. Most developers spend more time reading than writing code, so gaining experience reading code is valuable. It can also be overwhelming, particularly for new students, to engage immediately in writing code.

[PRIMM][primm] is a structured approach that builds to writing code. The steps in PRIMM are:

- predict
- run
- investigate
- modify
- make

The [linked post][primm] goes into more detail; there is no point in repeating it here. I just want to note that PRI force the student to challenge their mental model, which is important and not noted in the post.


## Learning with Others

Working in groups
