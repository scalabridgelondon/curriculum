# Section 2 Outline

Section 2 introduces core functional programming concepts: functions, algebraic data types, and structural recursion over algebraic data types. The approach is "do stuff" first, and then explain concepts.

We continue to use Doodle, but should look at adding another domain at the section progresses. I've suggested a Twitter bot below.


## Goals

Students can:

- declare and use functions and function types
- understand type signatures with generic types
- apply structural recursion over `List`
- maybe map and flatMap?
- translate descriptions of data into algebraic data types
- apply structural recursion over algebraic data types



## Content

- Functions
  - This is currently introduced in Creative Scala using parametric equations for curves. This is fun, but requires explaining some concepts (polar coordinates, parametric equations) that are unfamiliar to some students. An alternative would be to implement a library for common tilings (e.g. square, hexagon)

- List
  - structural recursion over Lists
  - abstraction over structural recursion: map, flatMap
  
- Maybe introduce Random here? Same concepts but different context.
  
- Algebraic data types
  - structural recursion over algebraic data types
